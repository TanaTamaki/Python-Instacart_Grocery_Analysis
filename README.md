# Python-Instacart_Grocery_Analysis
 Instacart open-source datasets were analyzed to identify sales trends and purchasing behaviors, to refine customer segmentation for more effective marketing.

## Project Summary
Instacart has strong sales performance, but aims to gain deeper insights into its sales patterns. Stakeholders are particularly interested in the purchasing behaviors of their customers and recognize that a universal approach may not be effective. Consequently, a targeted marketing strategy is under consideration.

## Objective
This analysis derives insights into customer buying habits to enable Instacart to customize their marketing campaigns to more effectively target customer profiles, enhance the relevancy of promotions and ads, and boost sales.

## Data
 - Instacart open-source datasets were used for this project.
 - Data contains information about customers, departments, orders, and products.
 - ***Disclaimer**: Customer dataset and 'prices' column in the products data were fabricated for the purpose of this project with CareerFoundry.

## Tools 
- Python (libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel

## Analysis Focus
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Are there particular times of the day when customers spend the most money?
- Use simplier price range groupings for products to help direct marketing and sales efforts.
- Are certain types of products more popular than others?
- How do customer ordering behaviors differ?
- What is the distribution of users in regard to brand loyalty?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on loyalty status, region, age, family status, income?
- Are there differences in ordering habits of different customer profiles?

## Python Skills Demonstrated
  - Data cleaning (consistency checks: handling duplicates, missing values, mixed-type variables)
  - Merging dataframes
  - Deriving new variables (if-statements, user-defined functions, loc functions, for-loops)
  - Grouping and aggregating data (summary columns, descriptive statistics, flags)
  - Visualizations (histograms, pie charts, bar charts, line charts, scatterplots)
